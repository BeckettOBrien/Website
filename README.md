# My Website
This is a REAMDE. That means you must read it. Or you could not read it, no one can force you. Especially if you didn't read it. Anyway, in this document you will find content. Right now there are some dumb frequently asked questions that no one has actually asked, and a link to the website for which this repository is housing. I recommed you check out the site first because its pretty cool, and the experience will be ruined if you look through the source first.
