I finally found a better way to just get DOM elements to fall. I would've liked to be able to make parents fall but it started getting really complicated.
It's been really difficult to get motivated to work on anything recently, but I'm really happy to finally be working on this again.
I still have some cleanup to do, like removing commented or unused code, and some matter.js issues to fix (things sometimes glitch through the floor and don't settle down when they should stop moving) but I'm happy with it for now.
