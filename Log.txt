Right now, I've gotten a lot of the pyhsics stuff to work, but this is what I still have to fix:
    - Keep text transform to a box, not an infinite-width rectangle
    - Keep text transform when an element is removed from a flexbox (when the buttons fall)
    - Get the mouse to fall too, because that would be pretty funny

Anyway, I'm gonna keep working but I feel like I should put more random stuff here in the future :D
