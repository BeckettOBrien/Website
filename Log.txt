I have a little bit of an idea of what I'm going to add next, but not much beyond that.
It's been really difficult stringing together certain things because I kinda worked on things out of order.
Like, I started the reboot scrolling text thingy before I added user interaction for the matter-js part.
And I still haven't figured out how I'm getting to the crash from the first button falling.
At least I got the matter-js stuff fairly polished now (somehow I was using a version 0.12 release instead of the latest).
